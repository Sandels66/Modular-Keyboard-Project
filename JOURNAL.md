## 10/30/2025 - Start! and research! and pain! (30/10/2025)  

So, maybe you're wondering how i decided on this. Simple. I Enjoy Pain. also i like jumping into the deep end, buut... minor details.

The goal for the Modular Keyboard Project is as follows:
1. Make something that i'd actually want to use, not just a throwaway cheapo keyboard.
2. Get some experience with anything really, since this is my first ever hardware project that will go beyond conception.
3. Make something flexible. Sometimes i could need a numpad, other times a split keyboard or something easily baggable. 
4. Have fun! 

_(maybe i'll even pick some cool prizes up)_

Okay, so I think i have some stuff researched:

-QMK doesn't natively support multiple slaves, but it has i2c support so i could write something for it. problem, i don't know how to code. Nor would i know how to go about implementing it. More research needed.

-I'm debating on whether or not i should make a central master node that i can attach to the modules, kinda like devboards on sockets or whatever they're called. Except modular and with pogo pins. OR a tiny keyboard, like 60-65% and having everything attach to that instead. I'd lose the possibility for a split board module, but it really depends.

-OH yeah, i think i'm going to use magnets and pogo pins for attaching stuff to the master node, cause i like magnets and pogo pins would be the easiest, me thinks.

Next, i'm going to have to pick up an ssd solely for windows and Fusion 360. I'd use something like winboat, but it doesn't have gpu acceleration yet. also i need to figure out QMK more, if i need to write a custom module for it. and i need to research the i2c protocol.

I Have A Lot Of Work To Do.
